Compiling
=====================

The GUI workflow can be converted to a JSON schema or Pyteal source code.

When the "Export JSON schema" button is clicked, a JSON file is downloaded, called asc-builder.json, which can be imported to create another project with the same data.

A typical Pyteal source code result would appear thus:

.. figure:: ./assets/compiled.png
  :align: center

The code can be copied to clipboard and then executed to generate TEAL code.
